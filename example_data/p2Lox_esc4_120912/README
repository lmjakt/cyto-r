The text files in this directory:

549_1_d, 734_1, 763_2_d, APC, PE, etc. were extracted from the .fcs files by
running the fcs2text.pl script on the .xml file that describes the samples.

This requires that the 'read_fcs' binary has been compiled from the sources in
the fcs3_reader/ directory, and that this binary lies in the path.

Each text file represents the analysis of a single data set.

The .R file contains a set of commands that can be used to look at the data in
various ways.

There may be bugs in the R code, and others may require modification on other systems.

If you should come across such problems or have other trouble, then don't hesitate to
contact me.
