To compile & install.

1. Make a suitable Makefile, to include the headers and sources described in the .pro
   file. I tend to use qmake for this, but something like tmake might also work. If you
   know what you're doing, write it yourself. (I don't, hence the use of qmake).

2. make

3. Move the resulting binary file (read_fcs) to somewhere in the path (eg. ~/bin) or change
   your PATH, or set up some links to achieve the same.

That's it.

Alternatively, since there are only two source files, you can compile by:

g++ -o read_fcs fcs3.cpp main.cpp

Which is probably simpler. (The Makefile is good to have if you want to make changes
to the source code, in which case you probably know what you're doing).
